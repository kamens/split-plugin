# Split Analysis: Elbo Books Landing Page

## The lineup
- **OGILVY** — proof-obsessed ad man. Demanded data, specific testimonials, and longer persuasive copy.
- **GODIN** — tribes evangelist. Asked who the specific buyer is and whether the product is remarkable enough to spread.
- **DUNFORD** — positioning queen. Interrogated the competitive frame and why the page doesn't name an enemy.
- **SCHWARTZ** — awareness-level savant. Questioned whether the page is calibrated to the right stage of buyer sophistication.

## They all agree on this

Every single mind said the same thing, in their own way: **your testimonials are the best copy on the page, and your headline is the worst.**

Ogilvy put it bluntly: "The headline 'A personalized activity book made just for your child' doesn't sell anything. It's a category description." Godin called it "forgettable — every personalized product says this." Dunford said it's "a feature description masquerading as a positioning statement." Schwartz diagnosed it as "calibrated to awareness level 2.5 when your traffic is at level 3 or 4."

Meanwhile, the testimonials are doing all the real work. Adler's mom saying "I'm struck by his insistence that we work on it!" — Ogilvy flagged that as a better headline than anything currently on the page. Schwartz said it "channels parental desire to see their kid engaged and delighted." Godin noted the testimonials "aren't about the book, they're about the parent watching their child succeed."

All four also agreed: **the "screen-free" angle is your most powerful weapon and you're barely using it.** It shows up in one testimonial ("something that isn't a screen!!") and in the TODAY endorsement ("Best Screen-Free Toys"), but it's never stated as a primary value proposition. Dunford's diagnosis was the sharpest: "'Best Personalized Gifts' is a red ocean — Etsy has 10,000 personalized gift options. 'Best Screen-Free Toys' is a category with a villain and an urgent problem."

They also unanimously agreed: the bullet points in the hero section are "feature vomit" (Ogilvy's phrase). They describe what the product IS rather than what it DOES for the parent and child. "Educational activities starring your child and their passions" tells me nothing about the experience. The testimonials tell me everything.

## They fought about this (and worked it out)

### The Headline War: Outcome vs. Mechanism (Ogilvy vs. Schwartz)

Ogilvy came out swinging: rewrite the headline to sell the behavioral outcome. His suggestion: "The activity book that finally keeps them engaged (without screens)." Lead with what parents want — proof their kid will actually use the thing.

Schwartz pushed back hard. He argued this is a *sophisticated* market — parents have seen Wonderbly, I See Me, Put Me In The Story. Another promise-based headline won't cut it. You need to show the **mechanism** — the specific reason this works when other personalized books don't. His headline: "The personalized book that's actually puzzles, mazes, and activities — not another story they'll hear once."

When pressed, Ogilvy evolved. "Schwartz is right about the market sophistication," he conceded. "If visitors are comparing this to story books, the headline needs to do different work." His updated take: lead with mechanism contrast, then let the testimonials prove the outcome. Something like: "The personalized book that's actually challenging: puzzles, mazes, and activities matched to their age."

Schwartz, in turn, conceded to Ogilvy on what the *desire* actually is. "These parents aren't comparing to Wonderbly. They're desperate for engagement that lasts." He updated his recommendation: use Ogilvy's outcome-driven headline but with the mechanism immediately following as proof.

> **Practical upshot:** The headline should combine both — outcome first, mechanism as the "because." Something like: "The activity book that finally keeps them engaged — because every puzzle is about *their* passions." Then the subhead can position against story books: "Not another personalized story they'll hear once. 50+ pages of puzzles, mazes, and crosswords starring their interests."

### Tribe vs. Enemy: Who Do You Serve vs. What Do You Replace? (Godin vs. Dunford)

Godin said the #1 problem is "Ages 4-14" — a 10-year span that's "not a tribe, it's a population." He wanted the page rewritten for one specific parent: the parent of a 5-8 year old struggling with screen time.

Dunford said the #1 problem is the missing competitive alternative. The "What Makes Elbo Books Different?" section lists four features — different from WHAT? Without naming an enemy, differentiation has no meaning.

Both evolved toward each other. Godin conceded: "Dunford's right that you can't differentiate without knowing what you're differentiated *from*." But he brought a key insight: "Name the enemy first, then narrow the tribe within that frame." The enemy is the iPad/screen time, but that enemy resonates differently for different age groups. For parents of 5-year-olds, it's fear of attention problems. For parents of 12-year-olds, it's fear of social media.

Dunford agreed the two decisions are inseparable: "The 'ages 4-14' span proves they haven't chosen their tribe, which means they can't commit to the enemy." Her updated take: narrow the tribe first, and the competitive frame snaps into focus.

> **Practical upshot:** Pick the enemy (iPad/screen time), then narrow to the tribe where that enemy is most acute (parents of early elementary kids, roughly 5-8). The messaging follows: "An hour of focus that isn't a screen" aimed at parents who feel daily guilt about screen time.

## They couldn't agree on this (your call)

### Is "3 Minutes" a Feature or a Bug? (Ogilvy vs. Godin)

This was the one true unresolved clash.

**Ogilvy** defended the "3 minutes, no credit card needed" messaging and the "Memorable gifts, in minutes" section. His argument: at $29.99, "Is this hard to make?" is a real buying objection. The 3-step section proves the customization is REAL — those interest bubbles and photo-to-character transformations show specificity, not cheapness. "Removing friction doesn't cheapen premium products — it removes the suspicion that 'personalized' means a mail-merge name insertion."

**Godin** stood firm: "This product's value is not in the transaction, it's in the transformation of the gift-giver's status." Parents aren't saying "it was so easy to make!" in testimonials — they're saying "I was SUPER happy" watching their child succeed. Leading with ease attracts impulse purchases and high returns. Leading with "you notice what others miss about your kid" attracts rabid fans who text their friends. "Which would I rather have? The latter. That's how Purple Cows spread."

> **The deciding factor:** Where you place the "3 minutes" messaging on the page signals what you think it is. If it's reassurance (near the CTA, in small text), Ogilvy wins — it removes a friction point. If it's the headline of a whole section, Godin's right — you're leading with the wrong story. Consider keeping the ease-of-creation info but reframing the section header: instead of "Memorable gifts, in minutes," try "You know them best. Show them." Then the 3 steps become about the parent's knowledge of their child, not the speed of the transaction.

## Questions they raised that you should answer

1. **What does the actual TODAY article say?** Ogilvy and Dunford both flagged that you're using the TODAY endorsement three times but never showing the actual pull quote or review. Get it and feature it prominently.
2. **Do you have data on your best-fit customer age?** Everyone said "Ages 4-14" is too broad. Before you narrow, check your order data — which age group reorders, refers friends, and leaves the best reviews?
3. **What's your return/satisfaction rate?** Ogilvy wants a guarantee ("If your child doesn't love it, we'll refund you completely"). Do you have the data to back that?
4. **How many books have you sold?** Schwartz suggested social proof scarcity: "Over 1,000 parents have ordered in the last 30 days." If you have the numbers, use them.
5. **Is the FAQ above the testimonials intentionally?** Every mind questioned why the FAQ (a defensive, objection-handling section) appears before the testimonials (your best proof). This seems like a page structure issue worth testing.

## What to do next

**Priority 1: Rewrite the headline** (All 4 minds)
Kill "A personalized activity book made just for your child." Replace with an outcome + mechanism headline. Test something like: "The activity book that finally keeps them engaged — because every puzzle is about *their* passions." Follow with a subhead that positions against story books.

**Priority 2: Commit to the "screen-free" frame** (Dunford + Schwartz)
Lead with "Best Screen-Free Toys" from TODAY, not "Best Personalized Gifts." Reframe the competitive context: you're the alternative to another hour on the iPad, not another item on an Etsy gift list.

**Priority 3: Move testimonials up** (Ogilvy + Godin)
They should appear immediately after the hero section, before the FAQ. They're your best proof, your best copy, and your real positioning. The FAQ can go below the fold.

**Priority 4: Rewrite the bullet points as outcomes** (Ogilvy + Schwartz)
- "Educational activities starring your child" → "Finally, something that keeps them busy for hours (without screens)"
- "Difficulty matched to age and development" → "Puzzles hard enough to challenge them, easy enough they don't give up"
- "Their unique interests become personalized puzzles" → "Their obsession with dinosaurs becomes a dinosaur maze, a dino crossword, a dino word search..."

**Priority 5: Narrow the age range** (Godin + Dunford)
Check your data, but consider leading with "Best for ages 5-8" or at minimum segmenting the messaging. A parent of a 6-year-old and a parent of a 13-year-old have completely different concerns.

**Priority 6: Get the TODAY pull quote** (Ogilvy + Dunford)
You're citing the endorsement three times but never showing what they actually said. The actual review language is worth more than the logo.

**Priority 7: Add a guarantee** (Ogilvy)
"If your child doesn't love it, full refund." You're asking parents to spend $30 on something sight-unseen and personalized. A guarantee removes the last objection.

**Priority 8: Reframe "Memorable gifts, in minutes"** (Godin, partially Ogilvy)
Keep the 3-step section but change the framing from speed to parental insight. "You know them best" as the header, with the steps showing how that knowledge becomes a one-of-a-kind book.

## Raw reactions

### OGILVY (Round 1)

This page is trying to sell on "personalization" when it should be selling on the *result* of that personalization — a child who's actually engaged, learning, and off screens. The headline is descriptive wallpaper. The proof elements are present but buried. And the pricing creates unnecessary friction by mentioning "no credit card needed" — which telegraphs doubt before the customer even has it.

**What's working:** The testimonials contain the only real selling copy on the page. "He was so excited to see his name in the word search. I'm struck by his insistence that we work on it!" — that's a specific behavioral outcome. "She had never done a sudoku before. But she understood and was able to get the 2x2! I was SUPER happy." — proof of age-appropriate difficulty working in practice. The TODAY endorsement is legitimate third-party validation. The visual proof — actual book pages with real children's names, the before/after photo transformation — shows rather than tells.

**What's not working:** The headline "A personalized activity book made just for your child" doesn't sell anything. It's a category description. The bullet points are feature vomit. The FAQ accordion above the fold is defensive — answering objections before making the sale. "3 minutes, no credit card needed until purchase" assumes the customer is already worried about commitment. The TODAY endorsement appears three times but never with the actual quote or review.

**Top recommendation:** Rewrite the headline to sell the outcome, not the format. Test: "The activity book that finally keeps them engaged (without screens)" or "An activity book so personalized, they'll actually finish it."

**Secondary:** Move testimonials up. Get the actual TODAY review quote. Rewrite bullets for outcomes. Add a guarantee.

### GODIN (Round 1)

This page is confused about who it's for and what story it's selling. "Ages 4-14" is a ten-year span — that's not a tribe, that's a population. The hero section reads like a feature list trying to convince me the product is good, when what I need to know is: *who do I become when I give this?*

**What's working:** The testimonials are gold — they're about the *parent watching their child succeed*. The product image showing a real kid engaged with the book does more work than any bullet point. The "Their unique passions become unique pages" visual callouts finally show why this is remarkable.

**What's not working:** "A personalized activity book made just for your child" is forgettable. "3 minutes, no credit card needed" is friction language. The "Memorable gifts, in minutes" section undermines scarcity — if it's that easy, is it that special? The page positions against nothing.

**Top recommendation:** Pick a specific parent. Parents of early elementary kids (5-8) watching their child struggle to stay focused. Rewrite everything for that parent. The headline becomes: "A book where your child is finally the main character."

**Secondary:** Move "screen-free" from footnote to primary tension. Change CTA to outcome language. Kill or split "Ages 4-14."

### DUNFORD (Round 1)

This landing page is doing positioning by accident, not by design. They've landed on "personalized activity book" without defining what they're replacing or why that matters. The result: a laundry list of features with no competitive anchor.

**What's working:** The testimonials do the heavy lifting the page refuses to do. The "Their unique passions become unique pages" section translates features to value visually. The "three minutes" callout addresses a real friction point for personalized products.

**What's not working:** "A personalized activity book made just for your child" is a feature description masquerading as a positioning statement. The "What makes Elbo Books different?" section lists attributes without a competitive frame — different from WHAT? "Ages 4-14" is not a best-fit customer. Two TODAY categories ("Best Personalized Gifts" AND "Best Screen-Free Toys") straddle two competitive frames without committing. $29.99 with a sale banner screams commodity, not premium gift.

**Top recommendation:** Pick your enemy and name it. "Unlike another hour on YouTube, this is screen-free engagement starring THEM." Give me a villain so your differentiation has meaning.

**Secondary:** Narrow age range or segment. Choose "Best Screen-Free Toys" as the stronger frame. Rewrite "What makes Elbo Different?" with explicit competitive context.

### SCHWARTZ (Round 1)

This page is confused about who's walking through the door. It's written for solution-aware prospects but the headline treats them like they're problem-aware. That mismatch is killing the page. The market is sophisticated — they've seen Wonderbly, I See Me, Put Me In The Story. The page knows this (differentiating with "activity book" not "story book") but abandons that differentiation immediately.

**What's working:** The testimonials channel parental desire perfectly. "Their unique interests become personalized puzzles" is the MECHANISM — the thing that separates this from story book competitors. But it's buried as a bullet point. "3 minutes, no credit card needed" is brilliant for reducing friction at the product-aware stage.

**What's not working:** The headline is calibrated to awareness level 2.5 when traffic is at 3-4. Bullet points don't connect to desire. "Launch sale ends Feb 15" is premature urgency for someone who doesn't understand why they need the product yet.

**Top recommendation:** Rewrite the headline for a solution-aware, sophisticated market: "The personalized book that's actually puzzles, mazes, and activities — not another story they'll hear once."

**Secondary:** Move mechanism to headline/subhead. Rewrite bullets to channel desire. Replace launch urgency with social proof.

### Round 2 Responses

**OGILVY** evolved on the headline — conceded to Schwartz that mechanism matters in a sophisticated market. Updated recommendation: lead with mechanism contrast, let testimonials prove the outcome. Pushed back on Godin about the 3-step section: "Removing friction doesn't cheapen premium products — it removes the suspicion that 'personalized' means a mail-merge name insertion."

**SCHWARTZ** conceded to Ogilvy on the core desire — parents aren't comparing to competitors, they're desperate for engagement. Updated: use Ogilvy's outcome-driven headline with mechanism as proof in the subhead. Pushed back on Godin's audience-first argument: "Sophistication determines the message strategy. Segmentation determines the media buy. Get the first one wrong and the second one doesn't matter."

**GODIN** evolved toward Dunford — agreed to name the enemy first, then narrow the tribe. "Lead with 'An hour of focus that isn't a screen' as the frame, then speak to the specific parent." Pushed back hard on "3 minutes" messaging: "If you lead with '3 minutes,' you'll get impulse purchases and high returns. If you lead with 'you notice what others miss about your kid,' you'll get rabid fans who text their friends."

**DUNFORD** evolved toward Godin — agreed the tribe and enemy decisions are inseparable. "Narrow the tribe first, and the competitive frame snaps into focus." Pushed back on Schwartz's awareness-level approach to frame selection: "'Best Screen-Free Toys' wins not because of traffic awareness but because it creates the strongest differentiation. Lead with 'personalized gifts,' you're competing with Shutterfly. Lead with 'screen-free,' you're solving a daily pain point."
